### Bugs

### Improvements
- Show PR creation date after the URL.
- Add 'requested PRs' to the formula.
- Shell autocompletion.
- Add validation for --org and --repo used at the same time. Or ignore the first one.
- Add Homebrew formula.
- URLs to PRs can be displayed with shorter text in terminal (cmd+click still works), example in tty-link. It can save some space in console, but not all terminals support it.
